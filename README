Hello!

This is the cloud folder where I put all kind of unorganized JavaScript code that I write while I learn.
Basically these are Javascript junks, like challenges, overused concepts and algorithms, so nothing practical.
Although If you find something useful, take it freely. If you need some info about any topic there, 
  just message me on coding.alma@gmail.com . 

I'm glad to be part of this community. 
Live long and prosper.
